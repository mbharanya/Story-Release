A little worm is making his way through the dirt, eating rotting leaves and small nuggets of food. Poking his head out of the newly wet soil is all that was needed for a nearby crow to spot it. With a quick swoop it has the worm in it's beak and heads off to it's nearby nest. Little chirping noises of despair greet the mother providing for her offspring.
A loud rumbling noise bellowed across the field below them and startles the mother. The worm takes his chance and tries to slither away, only to fall several meters to the ground with a small "plop" sound.
Another, even louder sounds starts to vibrate the tree. Loud chirping from the younglings adds to the symphony of the soundscape. The mother tries to shield her offspring with her wings as the whole tree is vaporized by the impact.

A small red LED just turned on a large dashboard. A thick layer of dust covers the console, except for a few keys that are used frequently. Carry swivels her chair upright and takes a look at the now blinking light.

Brian was really starting to get worried. What was the first thing he did after he received the warning? He stupidly told his manager. What if Ashe belonged to the people that the strange woman warned him about? Also, so far he just ignored all of the warnings, but he couldn't just leave it be. Something in him drove him to explore more about his abilities, even though he was scared of the consequences. Maybe his good friend Bo will finally explain everything, especially how to contact the lady and what he needed to be careful about. 
Two more hours left, he wished he was able to fast forward time. So far he was able to get what he wished for, when he concentrated very hard on it. Maybe he could manipulate time? That did sound interesting but also very risky. What if he got caught in a groundhog-day scenario, stop time or create some other timey-wimey stuff? Brian thought it would best to not risk it at this time. But he liked pondering about all the possibilities. He still did not figure out what exactly he could do, maybe he was only able to change stuff with fibers? "Like the air fire and water benders I know from TV shows. Maybe I'm a ... fabric bender?".

_Beep beep beep_ - The alarm that Brian set finally rang. It was time to leave. He was ecstatic. He grabbed his coat, and made sure to pack his bike lock and wooden wand. The city was quiet at this time. Brian felt the cool breeze of the fresh midnight air on his skin. He took a deep breath. He was not this excited and also worried since forever. He increased his pace, he needed to release the pent up nervousness somehow, he almost ran over a man on the sidewalk. Finally he saw the familiar neon letters of his favorite eatery. The bald silhouette of his dear friend appeared. He was cleaning the counters peacefully. Brian walked to the counter, Bo looked up from cleaning a glass with a filthy rag and smiled. The place was empty. 

"You are right on time, I'm just closing up" 

Bo rummaged in his pocket and held out a piece of chocolate in his hand for Brian to take. "Put this in your mouth, it will help".
A bit confused about receiving pocket chocolate Brian accepted, blew off a bit of dust of the piece and ate the dark piece of chocolate.
Bo put down a glass and the rag and closed down the restaurant. Bo pointed to a dark place in the alley next to his restaurant. "Please, follow me there. Do not be afraid".

Bo was acting quite mysteriously and Brian started to suspect that maybe something weird was going on. But his curiosity and hunger for answers got the upper hand. He followed Bo into the dark alley.
"Empty your pockets please and give me the bike lock and wand please. I'm afraid you'll also need to lose your pants."

"How did you know about what I had in my pockets?"

"It's rather obvious, please just take the things off now"

"Bo, is this an elaborate prank? Walking into a dark alley and telling me to take off my pants? Come on!"

"It is not to be joked about. This is serious business". A deep brow formed in Bo's face.

Brian thought hard about this, what if he just walked away from all this craziness? There was no harm. But he decided to trust his friend, he did seem quite serious. Slowly he took out the wand, bike lock and gave it to Bo.

"The pants too, please I don't have all night"

Reluctantly Brian started to take off his pants. Bo took the wand and broke it in two, revealing a silvery shining core inside. It seemed to be made of some kind of bleached hair.

"No! My wand! Why did you do that?"

Bo ignored the question and put the pants and bike lock in a pile. He lazily threw on the broken wand as well. He looked at them intently and then put his foot on the items. They crumbled to dust as if there were just loosely held together before.

Brian looked at the pile that used to be his pants and other personal items. He was still mad about the wand, it was quite a fascinating object and he kind of felt that he was a proper wizard with it now.

"I'm sorry to have upset you, you will understand soon" - Bo said with kindness in his eyes.

"Please close your eyes and count to ten"

It got more and more sketchy now, what's gonna happen next? Still, Brian complied and closed his eyes. 

"1, 2, 3, 4, ..." Brian opened his eyes. But there was nothing. No, not blackness, nothing at all, it was as if his eyes did not work at all. In the next blink of his eye Brian's vision returned. He felt very dizzy, as if he just came off of a rollercoaster. Slowly he  examined the new place. They seemed to be in some kind of forest, it was warm and the pleasant odour of exotic plants rushed over Brian. 
It was warm, much warmer than in the dark alley. Natural light as bright as the day seemed to come from above, but when Brian looked up he only saw a dark blue color and was that a ... fish?
They seemed to be in the middle of the ocean, fish swimming around them. After a closer look Brian noticed that they were protected by a bubble. A literal large bubble filled with air, plants and grass at his feet.
They were standing near a small patch of trees, with some shrubs around.

"Where are we Bo?"

"Welcome to my home, sorry for all the mystery. Oh you must feel uncomfortable, let me get you something to wear". Bo made a strange sound, it almost sounded like a small whistle. This action seemed to summon an army of worms. They were about as large as Brian index finger and wiggled a lot. There were thousands of them, appearing from many crevices. Brian jumped away, startled.

"Don't be frightened, they are just silk worms. I told them to manufacture some pants for you"

With amazing speed the little worms started to spit out little threads and moving in parallel lines to form a piece of fabric. It grew larger and larger.

"Did you know that people boil them alive in their cocoons, just to get a bit of silk? I find it very cruel, you can just ask them to produce it for you, and as long as you give them some mulberry leaves as payment they are happy."

Brian could barely close his gaping jaw. Bo seemed so casual about all of this stuff.

"You must understand that this is all super weird to me Bo. First of all are we under the ocean?"

"Yes, well spotted. I like fish a lot, so I thought why not build myself a little house under the sea to appreciate their natural beauty? Did you appreciate the bubble I made, I preferred it to glass, I just used air and the surface tension of water holds it up. It seemed like a much better solution to me."

The silk worms started to slowly but surely wiggle away and reveal a perfect pair of white-grey pants, made completely of silk.

"Go ahead, put it on, don't be rude they spent a lot of effort on it." Bo nodded to the wiggling worms. They did not respond, they just crawled back to the shrubbery and crevices they came from.

With a bit of hesitation Brian walked over and put on the pair of silky pants. They were incredibly... Well silky. They fit him perfectly.

"Come now, let's have some tea and chat. I have a lot to tell you, and I am sure you have a lot of questions"

They walked over to the small hut in the middle of the giant bubble. Brian admired the small building. It seemed to be made of a living tree with leaves and branches growing out of it, there were no sharp angles, nails or any signs of actually building it. It all seemed like it was a living tree that just happened to grow into the shape of a house. There were small leaves surrounding the windows. The windows weren't made of glass, just left open to the air.

There was also no door, there was an opening that fit a human perfectly in the place a front door would usually be.
Entering the place Brian could see that the grass that was growing outside extended inside the place. Glowing orbs of light were floating around inside the building, illuminating the space.

Bo lead him into the living room. The chairs seemed to made entirely out of living moss. "Please sit, I will get the cups". Their vibrant green and soft feel was very welcome to Brian's behind. All of the furniture looked just like nature just wanted to grow into exactly this shape. Nothing was cut, torn or manufactured in a human way.
Brian had time to admire the inside of the walls, they were covered in bark just like the outside. They were bare, no pictures or anything hanging on them to distract from the natural beauty of the seemingly natural formation.
There was a faint sound of a stream, gurgling. Brian noticed that the small stream was actually inside the living room, carrying crystal clear water. Bo arrived with two cups, also made from wood, not carved of course, grown out of wood. Bo took the cups and put them into the stream filling them up with the crystal clear water. From one of the corners he picked up some leaves and put them into the cups, now full of water. 

"There you go, I'm sure you'll enjoy the flavour. It's one of my experiments, I call it fireleaf." - Bo said handing the cup to Brian. At first Brian was a bit confused, the cup was cold from the stream water, but it slowly started to heat up. The leaves seemed to heat up the water around them, flavoring it at the same time.

Brian took a small sip, it was the perfect temperature, hot and comforting. He felt the liquid warm his belly. The flavor was nothing like he ever had before. The closest thing he could describe it as was something like spicy cinnamon combined with chillies and the heat of ginger.

"Well then, let me answer your questions" Bo began, taking a sip from his own cup with a smile.

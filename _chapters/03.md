Too many strange things started to pile up, first the pulverized bike lock and then the waterproof jeans. And the strange wooden thing in his pocket? What was it? Brian took the object out of his backpack. It still looked the same as before, man-made with a lot of care. It felt smooth in his hand, the grain of the wood sanded. It reminded him of a wand. Taking out the stick he shook it in a circular pattern "Wingardium Leviosa", pointing at a box on a shelf in the store.

Nothing happened. "Avada Kedavra, Simsalabim, Abraca Dabra, Open Sesame, Wingardium _Leviosaaa_". Still nothing. "Damn it so much for Hermione's correct pronunciation, I guess this is not a story. This is real life, magic does not work like this" - Brian pondered. 

"The magic must work somehow differently, what did I do when made my pants waterproof? I guess I just really wanted it to happen, I tried to imagine how the fibers soaked up the rain and how different kinds of fibers would solve the problem". Brian looked around for something to try to experiment on. He saw some paper wipes they used to clean the screens of the filthy customer's computers. They were pre-soaked with alcohol, to at least get rid of some of the nastiness. He took out one of the wipes and concentrated on it, he tried to imagine as hard as he could, how the cloth's tiny fibers were holding onto the cleaning solution. This went on for a while until, as always, Ashe couldn't help to tell him off.
"What are you doing here? Quit staring at the the wipe, I'm not paying you to slack off" - she said. Brian was too concentrated to notice or care, he just looked at the wipe. Trying to force it to become hydrophobic, just like his pants. Very slowly small droplets started to form on the surface. Content he wiped the small droplets off with his finger. Coming to senses again he saw the contorted face of his manager, apparently screaming at him. Brian just had enough of dealing with this and just tried to ignore the annoying woman. There was just too much going on that day. Ashe really did not like Brian ignoring her, she started to get close to his face yelling. Brian was getting more and more irritated, and seeing and _smelling_ his manager's face made him more and more angry. 
He tried saying something, but no words came out. The tension was interrupted by the wipe flying directly from the counter into Ashes face, finally shutting her up. 
Both she and Brian were perplexed. While strange, this was very effective in releasing the tension. Ashe, to the surprise of Brian started laughing. This was the first time Brian saw any kind of joy in her harsh face. So far she seemed like a quite a one-dimensional character, always just there to make his life harder. 

"What was that?" - Ashe asked. "Did this wipe just fly off of the counter?".

"I have no idea" - Brian responded. "Lot's of strange things are happening to me recently".

"Strange? Like what?"

"Well, this is gonna sound insane, but I managed to make my pants hydrophobic"

"Hydro-what now?"

"Hydrophobic, it means that it's water-tight and water just beads up instead of soaking it"

"So you used some kind of spray? Or something like that?"

"No no it wasn't like that, I just was really annoyed and I started to imagine what would solve my problem ... and then it just... it just kind of happened"

"Are you joking? You made your pants water resistant by thinking about it?!"

"No, I am being serious, I just thought about it and it just happened"

"Well I think you should stop drinking before you get to work" - Ashe seemed to return to her normal self.

"I'm sure it must've been the AC that lifted the wipe or something. Kinda weird, but let's get back to work please" - Ashe seemed more like Brian knew her.

"I'm pretty sure it was not a gust of wind, seems I can also make stuff fly somehow? It does seem to start sounding like the beginning of Harry Potter. What will be next? Talking to snakes?" - Brian humored himself.

He was kind of proud in the end, not only did he manage to pull out some droplets from the wipe, but he also managed to make a small object fly. That was quite cool. He was still a bit worried about the strange lady warning him, but what was he supposed to do? For the first time in his life he was able to have something like super powers, anyone would want to experiment with that. It also meant that he for once had something interesting to do, not just playing the local wizard for the goblin-customers.
Brian did start to feel like some kind of wizard after all. He even had a magical wand to accompany him.


Thankfully his work shift was finally over. Brian felt really drained. Not just the emotional drain of having to work at the store, but  physical one as well. He was so tired he was ready to fall asleep any moment. But the adrenaline of finally being able to do something cool kept him going. 
Playing with the wooden wand he walked through the city, looking for some lunch. There was this asian take away that he liked getting fried rice at. It was the perfect thing to satisfy the rumbling hole in his stomach. Bo, the owner was also one of the few people that was usually quite nice to him. Brian loved listening to his stories about China, how they drink beer from plastic bags over there. Bo got him to try a lot of weird ingredients, like stinky tofu, which was actually much more tasty than it smelled.

The smell of ginger and garlic intensified as he approached the small corner shop with big pink neon letters. Brian loved the horribly translated menus and descriptions above the counter, it just felt so human.

Bo smiled and wiped his sweat from his brow as he saw him approaching. "Hey Brian, what's up? Damn you look like shit, what happened?"

"You'll never believe what happened to me today Bo"

"My my pants were suddenly dry ... and there was a strange woman and flying napkins"

"Woah slow down, you're not making any sense. Hang on I'll whip you up your favorite, egg fried rice. You look like you need some food in you". Bo always looked out for Brian, and he gladly accepted the steaming bowl of perfectly cooked rice. He just knew how to get it perfect, ripping hot wok, toasting the rice to perfection.

Shoving down a spoon of the hearty dish, he told Bo about all the strange things that happened him today. Bo kept working on other dishes but listened carefully.

"You must think I'm crazy Bo, I'm sorry"

Bo with a twinkle in his eye looked at Brians rice bowl intently. Slowly all the grains of rice started to align in straight lines, perfectly stacking on top of each other. Brian almost choked on his food.

"How did you ...?"

Bo looked quite serious and said: "I'm sure you have a lot of questions, but I need to finish my shift. We can't talk here. It is not safe. Meet me here tonight after midnight when I finish my shift, I can explain. Eat your food quietly and then go home".

Brian, now nourished but with more questions than ever returned home. He looked at the clock every few minutes. Still another two hours until midnight. He paced around in his apartment, the bucket he put there from earlier was starting to overflow.
"Two more hours, what can I do to pass the time?"
